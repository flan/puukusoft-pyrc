IAL: IRC Abstraction Layer
	This refers to the code in PyRC.ircAbstraction. References to specific
	top-level calls generally refer to PyRC.ircAbstraction.ircInterface.
	Any direct documentation references to code implemented under
	PyRC.ircAbstraction.ircInterface warrants smacking the author, hard.
	Really, find me and tell me to fix it; this is supposed to be easy to
	work with, not something confusing.
