PyRC project goals:
	PyRC aims to be an exceedingly flexible, and truly "free", IRC client
	while avoiding design flaws which could compromise stability or
	security.
	
	Where ease of use and performance come into conflict at the design
	level, preference will be given to ease of use. After all, these days,
	users expect to be catered to, and a small (I'll make a concerted effort
	to minimize it wherever humanly possible) hit to performance over
	functionality is pretty acceptable. Heck, a lot of them use Windows --
	if they're willing to sacrifice that much of their system already,
	what's an IRC client that has a few extra K of overhead per hundred
	users in a channel?
