	<title>The Definition of a Dictionary</title>
	
	<para>Dictionaries are a special kind of object, not unlike Perl's hashes or
	Java's hashmaps, which associate arbitrary data with keys. If the key is
	known, the data associated with it may be quickly retrieved, like using a
	language dictionary to find the definition associated with a word.</para>
	
	<para>In Python, everything is an object, and Python's dictionaries, which
	are objects, may pair any two objects as key and data. This allows one data
	type to contain all other data types, such as strings, numbers, lists,
	functions, and even other dictionaries.</para>
	
	<para>Dictionaries, as stated, work on a system of keys. Suppose a
	dictionary were defined as <code>x = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 3: 'three'}</code>.
	The keys here are <code>['one', 'two', 3]</code>, and they may be used like
	<code>x['two']</code> to retrieve their data; this would return <code>2</code>.</para>
	
	<para>PyRC's API only uses strings as keys at the top level, but other
	objects are used where appropriate, so knowing how to use dictionaries is
	essential to developing useful plugins.</para>
	
	<para>This document exists to provide a reference for all dictionaries that
	comprise PyRC's API, but it will assume knowledge of Python. For a more
	gentle introduction, see the Plugin Development Handbook, available through
	PyRC's documentation page.</para>
