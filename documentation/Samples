Standalone Python Source Scanner:
	Scans Python directories recursively and generates warnings with severity
	levels.
	Writes temp files with sha-1 per-line hashes in the event of an abort;
	temp files begin with the last modified timestamp of the file being scanned.
	If the timestamp differs, the sha-1 hashes are ignored -- sha-1 hashes are
	used to skip lines that have already been passed by the user.

GUI behaviour:
F# to jump to server #; alt+# to jump to channel #

codEvent -> dictionary for all numbers + regexps for parsing


Use regexp objects for highlighting. | is a delimiter.
Let user specify one string, like "flan|rhx". Wrap in a regexp search/match/compiled object.
"(?:(?:flan|rhx)[,:]|, (flan|rhx))" is ideal.

Only read the server config file when using /server or listing/updating its contents.
Do not store the values in memory. Only use them to check for bindings before trying a DNS resolve.
If a parameter is set in the config file, but not set in the input, assume the config file's value; assume the given value in the event of a conflict.
[ZiRC] may have multiple addresses associated with it.
For each address beyond the first, tag it and its parameters with a number (port, port1, port2). These numbers will be popped off when read and arranged by int() value (so 1 = 01).
Use this methodology for perform, too.

Plugins are now threadsafe. Mention this in the docs.



DCC file objects, when active, should only have abort and poll methods.
They should broadcast their status at fixed intervals/milestones.

DCC chat objects just need send and abort. They'll broadcast on receipt.


When changing to a PM in the GUI, set the right scrollbar all the way to the right.
Restore it to its original position if it hasn't been changed by the user.
(Set its contents to the user's name and the name of the person the user is speaking to)


Detached windows will behave exactly like normal windows, but they'll detatch at a node, like a channel or a server.

Change Ping to Lag when a ping request automated is raised.

Update the Ping value every time the server is pinged or every half hour, whichever comes first.

Subclass textview and overwrite the word-wrap function with a text indent.



TextTag : http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/class-gtktexttag.html

Toss colour data into wOR.
Build an object for it on startup.


AI gets better at fighting enemies after defeating others of their kind (they gain more access to the profile data). Groups share properties.

Engine attribute: Each character/unit/whatever can have one or more area-of-effect auras that stack with like nearby auras.
These will affect every unit standing on them, granting, for example, immunity to fire to enemies and allies alike.
This can allow magically disinclined units to travel under the protection of mages.
However, conflicting auras should cancel each other out.

When casting spells, MP cost should be consistent (+/- a tiny amount) across power levels.
Instead of taking more MP, spells should take more time to prepare.
Spells may be interrupted prematurely, but they'll only have half the power of the level to which they were charged.

When initializing the engine, pass in the required level data, the active character and item data, and any relevant event data.
Call its 'run()' method.
It will return updated character and item data and any new events which have occurred.
This will make it possible to couple the engine with any interface module, and it will make it possible to use any interface module with any other engine.

Engine feature: falling columns.
When special columns have taken on a certain amount of weight, or another scripted/attack-initiated event occurs, they should fall to ALT:0.
This will effectively remove units from combat, unless they have insane jumping or teleporting abilities.
This should also trigger a three-turn stun effect, possibly with some damage, depending on the terrain (rocks hurt).
On recovering, mages should be able to cast spells as normal (assuming their sphere reaches high enough), but the trapped units can also be targetted by mages.
Of course, it's possible to place treasure in a location that can only be reached by letting a unit fall, or to place stairs out of the pit.



AI groups and spontaneous joint operations.
Each AI unit should have an intelligence level tag -- describe these tomorrow.



Tank-chans' contour vertices should change with modifications made to parameters.
Bigger engines for increased speed.
Larger wings and less body for increased manuverability.
Larger weapon mount points for increased attack.
Larger plating and more round shape for increased shielding.


tr.x td{} - applies pattern to all tds under tr.
td:first-child
td+td?



/mode #animesuki.os +b
View bans.



three-column table (time, name, text) + VScrollbar?

Nah.
One-column list with HBoxes.
Allows for more dynamic sizing.

On creation of list, generate iter with model.get_iter_first()
To remove, iter = model.remove(iter)
To add, model.append(hbox)

Boxes should have two labels: ((timestamp, name), (text))
label.set_selectable(True)

use_align=True
row_align=0


UIs should have an event level table that can be manipulated by the user.
Level 0: Default handling
Level 1: Default handling + print message, if any, to current context(s)
Level 2: Default handling + print message, if any, to all contexts


Child windows should clone network nodes.
gtk.TextBuffer.insert_with_tags_by_name
http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtktreemodel.html#method-gtktreemodel--get-iter-root

Make treeview dual-value and just avoid assigning a renderer to the second thing?

Contexts need to contain the following:
 buffer
 irc_context
 focus
 
 Write a manager that maintains references by iter and by irc:focus? (Two dictionaries)

Child windows should each get only one network node. The same node may be cloned across multiple children.
Or maybe they should have root status nodes that reflect the events of the main window that can be joined by multiple network nodes.

Or maybe they should have a root status node and be able to take any focuses, building intermediate network nodes as they go.

...Should DCCs be a child of status?
It kinda seems like they should, given that they're network-less.

TextTag tabs/indent/paragraph? Write timestamp/name, then texttag remainder of input as an indented paragraph?

Needs some way to pull timeout information from GLOBAL to set the progress bar.
